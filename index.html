            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey there! My name's Peter, and I'm a Bachelor of Computing student at the University of Guelph. I'm currently completing my Major in Honours Software Engineering Co-op, and a minor in Business.
            I am very passionate about computing, and I love challenges! One way Iâ€™ve challenged myself this past year was to improve my local community in the School of Computer Science (SoCS). 
            To help achieve my goal, I was the Vice President of Social Affairs in the Society of Computing and Information Science, and the Operations Manager for the Google Developer Student Club 
            which both helped foster a better sense of community that was once lost due to COVID-19. We helped bring the students in the SoCS back together and collectively ran over 20+ events,
            including our very own GDSCHacks hackathon which was an amazing success! GDSCHacks took months of planning and lots of preparation from the entire Google Developer Student Club team; 
            it was such a rewarding experience. 
            <br><br>
            Currently, I'm completing my first co-op work term within the School of Computer Science here at the University of Guelph! I'm working under Dr. Stacey Scott as a Content Developer for one of her
            research projects. Along with another co-op student, I'm developing a livestreaming platform using React.js, Node.js, Express.js, HTML, CSS, Firebase, and APIs provided by YouTube, and Spotify. It's
            been an amazing learning experience, and I've grown so much as a Software Engineer. With these new skills under my belt I am excited for the future ahead!

      Hello! My name is Peter, and I'm a Bachelor of Computing student at the University of Guelph. I'm currently completing my Major in Honours Software Engineering Co-op, and a minor in Business.
      Throughout my academic and personal journeys, I have acquired a broad set of technical skills in languages such as C, Python, and Java. 
      Additionally, I have used developer tools like Git/GitHub and Docker, and I am familiar with operating systems like Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. 
      These technical skills, along with my knowledge of project management tools such as Trello and Slack, will enable me to contribute effectively to any team I may be apart of.
      In my academic and personal projects, I have demonstrated the ability to use these technical skills in practical applications. Please feel free to take a look at any of my projects displayed below.

      Aside from my technical skills, my experience as a Mortgage Servicing Representative at MCAP has honed my soft skills. I have gained valuable experience in client communication, teamwork, and documentation, 
      which I believe will be beneficial in any collaborative environment. Additionally, I take many leadership initiatives within my University education, including volunteering for the Google Developer Student Club, where I helped plan an introduction to Web Development event 
      and assisted in the cohesiveness of the event's execution. I am also involved in the Society of Computing and Information Sciences as VP General, where I have currently planned an Introduction to Circuitry event, from start to finish; involving managing a budget, creating the event schedule, and facilitating it. 
      My active participation in my local community shows my ambition, dedication, as well as my problem solving, and collaborative abilities.      </p>
